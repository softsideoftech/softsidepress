# My motivation and accountability at Clara

I just wrote about how [I'd hire for motivation]() and what it means for me to be an [accountable leader](). The thoughts I wrote up were in response to my experience at Clara and other companies. Before that, they were at most intuitions and gut feelings. And before today, I had too much guilt and shame about my thoughts and behavior on the job to write about it in an honest way.

So how'd I do at my last job--at Clara? I wish I could say that I lived up to the ideals in the two essays above, but I didn't.
