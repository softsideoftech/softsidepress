# My motivation and accountability at Clara

![][lead-image-jpg]

I just wrote about how [I'd hire for motivation]() and what it means for me to be an [accountable leader](). The thoughts I wrote up were in response to my experience at Clara and other companies. Before that, they were at most intuitions and gut feelings. And before today, I had too much guilt and shame about my thoughts and behavior on the job to write about it in an honest way.

So how'd I do at my last job--at Clara? I wish I could say that I lived up to the ideals in the two essays above, but I didn't. I ended up leaving the company just a year after I joined with quite a bit of mutual frustration between me and my boss, Jeff the CEO. I was demotivated and had just enough accountability not to be a total ass. I didn't start this way, but I got there fast within the first 6 months.

## My Motivation

I've talked about how it's easier for me to hire people for motivation from the start then to make them motivated after-the-fact. I actually had a pretty good sense of what I was looking for before I joined Clara. Like most people, my motivations consisted of a combination of mastery, purpose, autonomy, and financial security.

### Mastery in Management
Prior to Clara, I was a Director of Software at Workday leading more than 50 people, mostly engineers. I felt like I leader, but I didn't feel like a manager. For various reasons, I had delegated most of my day-to-day management responsibilities to my friend, [Barzel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/barzelsegal/). He was my only report and as far as I could tell, he was doing a great job. People on our team were generally happy and the ones he worked most closely with admired him and appreciated his support in their personal development. Theoretically, this was great. I had hired Barzel a few years earlier when I became the CTO at Identified. This was my first pure management gig and I believed I needed someone better with people and with "real" management experience to help run the team. 

At first, I was happy with this arrangement as I didn't care that much about management. I mainly wanted to move the business forward as a way to advance my own career. But after a couple years of seeing how well people responded to Barzel and the skill he had with relationships, I started to develop an appreciation of management. I wanted to be good at it too. It was mostly an ego-driven thing for me, as effectively leveraging other people seemed to be the best way to have ever-increasing achievements. And high achievement was my preferred way of coping with my feelings lack of self-worth that I had since early childhood.
