# My motivation and accountability at Clara

![][lead-image-jpg]

I just wrote about how [I'd hire for motivation]() and what it means for me to be an [accountable leader](). The thoughts I wrote up were in response to my experience at Clara and other companies. Before that, they were at most intuitions and gut feelings. And before today, I had too much guilt and shame about my thoughts and behavior on the job to write about it in an honest way.

So how'd I do at my last job--at Clara? I wish I could say that I lived up to the ideals in the two essays above, but I didn't. I ended up leaving the company just a year after I joined with quite a bit of mutual frustration between me and my boss, Jeff the CEO. I was demotivated and had just enough accountability not to be a total ass. I didn't start this way, but I got there fast within the first 6 months.

## My Motivation

I've talked about how it's easier for me to hire people for motivation from the start then to make them motivated after-the-fact. I actually had a pretty good sense of what I was looking for before I joined Clara. Like most people, my motivations consisted of a combination of mastery, purpose, autonomy, and financial security.

### Mastery in Management
Prior to Clara, I was a Director of Software at Workday leading more than 50 people, mostly engineers. I felt like I leader, but I didn't feel like a manager. For various reasons, I had delegated my formal responsibility for day-to-day management to my friend, [Barzel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/barzelsegal/). He was my only report, and as far as I could tell, he was doing a great job. People on our team were generally happy and those he worked closely with admired him and appreciated his support in their development. A part of me was envious. I told myself and others that we were co-managing the team and I was doing a good job of it. But circumstance was murky and I wasn't sure if I was just fooling myself to to placate my ego. So about a year into this arrangement, I resolved to manage a team without Barzel to both develop and demonstrate some mastery of it.

### Purpose in Developing Others
I loved helping others grow at least as far back as high school when I was skipping some of my classes to tutor other kids in the Computer Science AP test. Back then a lot of my positive feelings came from the feeling of being useful to others and therefore having value in the world. It helped paper over the gaping holes I had in my self-worth. As I matured I 








Theoretically, this was great. I had hired Barzel a few years earlier when I became the CTO at Identified. This was my first pure management gig and I believed I needed someone better with people and with "real" management experience to help run the team. 

At first, I was happy with this arrangement as I didn't care that much about management. I mainly wanted to move the business forward as a way to advance my own career. But after a couple years of seeing how well people responded to Barzel and the skill he had with relationships, I started to develop an appreciation of management. I wanted to be good at it too. It was mostly an ego-driven thing for me, as effectively leveraging other people seemed to be the best way to have ever-increasing achievements. And high achievement was my preferred way of coping with my feelings lack of self-worth that I had since early childhood.
