# My motivation and accountability at Clara

![][lead-image-jpg]

I just wrote about how [I'd hire for motivation]() and what it means for me to be an [accountable leader](). The thoughts I wrote up were in response to my experience at Clara and other companies. Before that, they were at most intuitions and gut feelings. And before today, I had too much guilt and shame about my thoughts and behavior on the job to write about it in an honest way.

So how'd I do at my last job--at Clara? I wish I could say that I lived up to the ideals in the two essays above, but I didn't. I ended up leaving the company just a year after I joined with quite a bit of mutual frustration between me and my boss, Jeff the CEO. I was demotivated and had just enough accountability not to be a total ass. I didn't start this way, but I got there fast within the first 6 months.

## My Motivation

I've talked about how it's easier for me to hire people for motivation from the start then to make them motivated after-the-fact. I actually had a pretty good sense of what I was looking for before I joined Clara. Like most people, my motivations consisted of a combination of mastery, purpose, autonomy, and financial security.

### Mastery in Management
Prior to Clara, I was a Director of Software at Workday leading more than 50 people, mostly engineers. I felt like I leader, but I didn't feel like a manager. For various reasons, I had delegated my formal responsibility for day-to-day management to my friend, [Barzel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/barzelsegal/). He was my only report, and as far as I could tell, he was doing a great job. People on our team were generally happy and those he worked closely with admired him and appreciated his support in their development. A part of me was envious. I told myself and others that we were co-managing the team and I was doing a good job of it. But circumstance was murky and I wasn't sure if I was just fooling myself to to placate my ego. So about a year into this arrangement, I resolved to manage a team without Barzel so I could develop and demonstrate some mastery in engineering management.

### Purpose in Developing Others
I loved helping others grow at least as far back as high school when I was skipping some of my classes to tutor other kids in the Computer Science AP test. Back then a lot of my positive feelings came from the feeling of being useful to others and therefore having value in the world. It helped paper over the gaping holes I had in my self-worth. As I matured I became more content to simply create and hold space for others to grow. For individual engineers, that meant letting people take on technical challenges that were just beyond their level of competence and allowing them to struggle or even fail. As my teams got bigger, it meant inspiring my managers rather than "managing" them. In my last year and a half at Workday, Barzel started bringing more sytematic coaching to the management of our team and introduced us to the world of (adult development)[https://medium.com/@NataliMorad/how-to-be-an-adult-kegans-theory-of-adult-development-d63f4311b553], the ongoing process by which adults mature and develop are more complex and well adjusted way of being in the world. I wanted to take his work to the next level and make ongoing adult development an everyday part of how our my team operated. I was so excited about this that keeping it to my team felt like too small of an impact. I wanted to bring this kind of growth to as many people as I could possibly reach. I wanted to join a company early on to seed their culture with it and nurture its growth to touch thousands of people.

### Autonomy
Ever since high school (_hmm, is this a pattern?_) I've struggled with authority. It was around that time that I decided that I "knew better" and became skeptical of authority figures. The short of it was that I was emotionally repressed and cognitively strong. I was out of touch with the experiences of others and I was smart enough to concoct stories to rationalize my "rightness" and therefore others "wrongness". I learned from people's reactions not to be openly disrespectful, but it still leaked out from time to time. The worst of it came out in my adult life while I was at Workday and started clashing with my boss. We were both trying to avoid interpersonal conflict all while thinking that the other person was in the wrong an being a pain in the butt. It was quite painful for me to experience and I imagine my boss wasn't exactly thrilled either.






Theoretically, this was great. I had hired Barzel a few years earlier when I became the CTO at Identified. This was my first pure management gig and I believed I needed someone better with people and with "real" management experience to help run the team. 

At first, I was happy with this arrangement as I didn't care that much about management. I mainly wanted to move the business forward as a way to advance my own career. But after a couple years of seeing how well people responded to Barzel and the skill he had with relationships, I started to develop an appreciation of management. I wanted to be good at it too. It was mostly an ego-driven thing for me, as effectively leveraging other people seemed to be the best way to have ever-increasing achievements. And high achievement was my preferred way of coping with my feelings lack of self-worth that I had since early childhood.
