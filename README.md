## This is for you only if
- Instead of using Wordpress, Mailchimp, and Google Analytics, you'd rather host everything yourself.
- Wordpress has waaay more features than you care to have and you're fine with basic Markdown formatting for your blog.
- You're skilled with SQL and don't need pretty graphs for your analytics.
- You've got devops kung-fu skills and can handle the setup of your server, database, domains, and AWS SES on your own.
- You have a strange attraction to Go and don't mind futzing with the code to making things work the way you want them to.
