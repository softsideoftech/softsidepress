# What does it mean to be an accountable leader?
> _*As an accountable leader I need to stay strategically engaged, make realistic estimates, escalate issues in a timely manner, plug the holes in my team, and when necessary, work harder to be reliable.*_

<b>I’</b>ve been meaning to write about accountability for a while now. Back in early 2016, I joined Clara Lending as their CTO and started hearing the term “accountability” getting thrown around in leadership meetings. It was usually associated with missed deadlines or uncompleted tasks and that the company didn’t have enough of it. A lot of the talk was about engineering projects that were taking too long. Some people were implying that — maybe — we need to institute rewards and punishment to “fix” the problem. This scared me fast. I didn’t want any kind of “solution” imposed on me or my team just as I was starting out at the company. I didn’t even understand what the problem was. After the third time that this came up in a leadership meeting, I went online as soon as I got out and looked up accountability on Google. Here’s what it says right now:

> _Accountability: The fact or condition of being accountable. Synonyms are responsibility, liability, answerability._

The circular definition didn't help much excpet for sufacing some synonymns. Last two sounded scary. I didn’t want to be liable for something as that sounded like being in trouble and getting punished. As I was Googling around some more, I could see that accountability had something to do with meeting commitments, that much I knew already. But what if priorities change? Or the commitments are unrealistic? And who gets to decide what my commitments are?

Still worried, I turned to Craig, our strategic advisor. He was a retired ex-army mortgage industry veteran with decades of management experience. In our first one-on-one meeting, he was happy to talk about the strategy that worked for him over the years to help his teams be more accountable. The gist of what he said was that he would ask his people to come up with their own deadlines, which made it more likely that they would do whatever it takes to meet them. And, if they were proposing more time than Craig felt was appropriate or felt they couldn’t deliver for some reason, then he would work with them to restructure their commitments in a way that both of them could agree on. The important thing, Craig said, was that the person on the hook for a commitment actually helped create it and was bought into it from the start.

I still didn’t know what accountability was, but it sure sounded like it had to do with deadlines and commitments. But what about the countless smaller tasks that I do all the time? I can’t possibly set a deadline with my boss for every one of them. What about the factors outside of my control? If I miss a deadline because someone outside of my org messes up, does that mean I’m not accountable anymore? That can’t be right.

There has to be something more to accountability. There must be an accountable “way of being”. A way of seeing the world and behaving in it that is inherently accountable. I tried searching through my personal experience for when I have and haven’t been accountable for to come up with examples, but the past was too foggy for the level of detail I was looking for. And, what I could remember more clearly still had too much emotional baggage around it for me to be objective about it. So, I’ve decided to let my accumulated experience flow out intuitively through a hypothetical company…

## The Dough Business
<b>T</b>his is the story of the bread company called Crusty Delights, or CruD for short. They are the dominant bread company in the mid-west out of its St Louis headquarters. They’ve done some research and believe they found an expansion opportunity in the gentrifying districts of San Francisco. They believe there is a market there among cafe goers for larger, shinier, crustier croissants that they can make a healthy margin on and significantly fatten their profits. With the support of their CEO, their top 3 executives came up with the following plan:

* Adam (Sales): Deploy their sales team to crisscross the city and strike up deals with at least 100 cafes to buy their improved croissants each morning.
* Bob (Manufacturing): Set up a new bakery to produce the new croissants (remember, they are expanding here so they don’t have a facility yet)
* Carla (Logistics): Rent trucks and hire delivery drivers to get their product to their customers.

They estimate each of these projects will take about 3 months, so if they sequence them, the whole initiative will take 9 months. That’s a long time to take in a competitive market like San Francisco. And, the cafe owners won’t be excited about making a deal for frigin’ croissants that they have to wait 6 months or more for. AND property is expensive in SF so setting up a facility and not using it means you’re bleeding rent cash without the revenue to make up for it.

So naturally, they’re going to want to parallelize these, which means they’ll A) make the deals, B) set up the bakery, and C) prepare for delivery at roughly the same time. The people running these three projects had better trust each other. If everyone delivers what’s expected at the time it’s expected, then everything works out, CruD makes a killing selling its new product, and everyone involved are heros. But, if, say, the bakery takes two months longer than planned to set-up, then the sales team ends up with a bunch of angry cafe owners (and some cancelled orders) and some of the delivery drivers go out and find other jobs in the meantime.

But, Vlad, you might say, these things happen! Sometimes it’s hard to know for certain what it takes to complete a project. Often you don’t really know how long it will take or even how well it will work until you’re in the middle of it. And what the hell does all this have to do with accountability?


### Timely Escalation
Let’s explore this. What if Adam’s sales team hits the city and finds it harder to strike deals than they expected? At the rate they’re going they’ll likely end up with only half as many customers as they expected at the end of the 3-month plan. If this happens, then Bob from manufacturing will have arranged for more baking capacity than they can take advantage of and Carla from logistics will have hired too many drivers with too many trucks. What should have been a healthy margin for CruD might even turn into a loss.

Being the accountable salesperson that he is, as soon as Adam realizes that he won’t make his commitment for 100 customers in time, he lets Bob and Carla know (and probably his boss, the CEO) so they could adjust their plans. Maybe they’ll decide to cut their losses and cancel the project altogether. Or maybe they’ll simply scale down or slow their efforts. By warning his counterparts about his expected shortfall, Adam saved them from overextending themselves and practiced the accountability behavior that I’m calling _timely escalation_.

### Strategic Engagement
And what if Adam realizes too late? What if Bob already signed a 5-year lease for a big facility and needs the full scale of 100 customers to cover the monthy cost? What if Carla hired the full load of drivers? Firing half of them before they even start might hurt CruD’s reputation and make it hard to scale up their business in the region over the long-term. Well if Adam is truly accountable, he would have had the meetings and conversations to know what Bob’s and Carla’s timelines looked like. He would pay close attention to how sales were coming along and warn his colleagues before they went past the point of no return with their own plans (i.e. timely escalate to them). If he maintained enough context to understand how his part fits into the rest of the initiative, he’d be practicing _strategic engagement_.

### Realistic Estimation
But what if Adam always gets himself into this mess? What if he’s a natural optimist (like myself and many engineers I know) and believed he could get the 100 customers in 3 months, even though the reality was more like 12 months? Or maybe Bob and Carla said they only needed 3 months, so he felt pressured to agree to a faster timeline than he felt was realistic? I’ve been guilty of this one, too. It doesn’t matter what the reason is. If he consistently falls short of expectations, then Bob and Carla will quickly learn he’s unreliable. They might be frustrated and cynical about him. They might start padding their own estimates to avoid getting burned. Or they’ll insist on not doing their part until he’s mostly through with his, stretching out the timeline for the initiative and putting it at risk of missing the market opportunity, reducing short term revenues, etc. There are lots of potential problems if you can’t trust your peers to get their part done consistently. And in this case, the real problem would be Adam. If this is happening, Adam needs to learn how to do _realistic estimation_--and quickly.

Performing realistic estimation means only making estimates that have a basis in reality, ie data. If your boss asks you for an estimate and you don’t really know, the only accountable answer would be “I don’t know”. Gut feel doesn’t cut it unless you’ve already have made a career of accurate estimates in your field. So what does reasonable “data” for an estimate look like? If you’re an engineer, I’m going to do a whole blog post for you soon, so stay tuned. In Adam’s case it might be something like telling his boss (the CEO) along with Bob and Carla that he doesn’t know if he can get 100 customers and how long that might take, but that he’ll do some groundwork to find out. He might partner with Don from marketing to build a list of 1000 potential customers, segment them into similar groups, and maybe even try to sign a deal with a few to see what his sales velocity might look like. Then he could extrapolate and have a reasonable estimate. It might still be wrong, but it would be a hell of a lot better than simply accepting a deadline from up above or making a so-called “educated guess” before building experience with this particular market.

### Plugging The Holes
So Adam, being an expert in realistic estimation, goes ahead and sends his top two salespeople to to meet with potential customers for two weeks to get the data he needs before committing to a timeline. In the second week, one of his salespeople, Eva, calls in and lets Adam know that her husband had an accident and she needs to fly home to take care of him. The exec team was expecting Adam to make his case next week and he needs the feedback from those customers to make a realistic sales estimate. To add to the frustration, Adam had previously decided to let his other sales people take a short holiday before the big push knowing they had a lot of hard work coming up. What’s he to do now? Thankfully, Adam consistently allocates a chunk of his schedule to important but not critically urgent projects. This gives him potential slack in his schedule to deal with fires as they inevitably come up for top leaders like him. People are messy, and organizations of people even more so. In this case Adam had enough personal bandwidth to plug the hole and take a few client meetings himself until another salesperson got back from their time off. _Plugging holes_ in the team often means the manager has to do some of his team’s work for them. Sometimes because they aren’t available to do it and other times because they don’t have the skill yet. It’s one of the realities of accountable management. But Adam know’s better than to make this his go-to fix for any challenge that happens come up. He doesn’t want to disempower his team by micromanaging them and a become bottleneck for company growth.

So what if Adam seemingly does everything right, but still makes a mistake? One that simply rearranging his schedule isn’t going to fix. Let’s say he promised to tell Bob and Carla within the first month if sales were looking off but didn’t realize it until halfway through month two? Maybe Eva needed to take extended time off and he thought he could still get by? Maybe his sales tracking system had a bug that misstated the numbers? Or maybe he made bonafide data-driven predictions that didn’t play out in the real world. Whatever the issue, he has a tough call to make. He can escalate to his counter parts and ask them to change their plans. I mean hey, sometimes life happens. If Adam usually delivers on his commitments and his sales team has a reputation for delivering on target, then maybe he could simply apologize for the miss and promise to do better next time. But, what if he’s new to the CruD leadership team? Or perhaps he missed his targets a couple of times last year? Or CruD needs this win soon to secure needed investment? There’s a chance Bob and Carla won’t care what Adam’s reasons are no matter how legitimate they may be. Pretty soon they’ll start thinking of Adam as unreliable, which would lead to all the same problems as unrealistic estimates: downstream teams get frustrated and start adding padding to their plans so they themselves could be reliable. Ever wonder how big companies often get so jaded and inefficient? It only takes a few bad apples to spoil the whole lot.

### When to Work Harder
So what’s Adam to do? Well, if changing the plan isn’t an option, he can try to make up his shortfall by working harder. OK, it’s never that simple. Adam might have a wife and kids that love seeing their daddy come home for dinner. He might have a team that also has families, friends, hobbies, and other commitments. And most people are fans of their sleep. Working harder comes at a cost. Is Adam prepared to pay that cost? Is his team? And by the way, how is his relationship with his team? Will they trust that Adam has their interests in mind or will they think that they’re the ones paying the price for his incompetence? There are no perfect answers to these questions. Assuming Adam and his team are not already killing themselves putting in long days and weeks, then working harder can be an option. Done right it can preserve Adam’s and his team’s reputation, ensure CruD’s new initiative is successful, and even improve his team’s morale with a tough victory despite the personal costs. How to do this well is something I’ll talk about in a future post. Just remember it’s ok to _work harder to stay reliable_ when things go badly. Just don’t make a habit of it or else the personal costs will catch up with you. They always do. If you find yourself working hard all the time to make up for some shortfall, revisit the other four behaviors of accountability as that’s where your challenge will most often lie.

<b>S</b>o here’s what I could have done at Clara if I really wanted be an accountable leader:

> _**Engage strategically**_ to understand the larger context around my projects.

> _**Make realistic estimates**_ so my peers could construct their own plans around mine.

> _**Escalate in a timely manner**_ so my peers could adjust to surprises.

> Structure my activities so I could _**plug the holes**_ in my team to keep things running smoothly.

> And if really necessary, I'd _**work harder to stay reliable**_. 

And how did I actually do at Clara? On a scale of one to ten, I’d give myself a six or seven. I have some regret looking back and wish I had done some things differently. I did well with estimating and escalating, just OK with with plugging holes and working harder when necessary, and at times, I did a mediocre job of engaging strategically. I’ll do a whole post-mortem on my time at Clara in another essay.
