# The Tools I Use to Reach Alignment and Buy-in

![][lead-image-jpg]

<b>I’</b>ve gotten aligned with people in as quickly thirty seconds over a side chat during a meeting. And I’ve heard stories of captains of industry taking months or even years building relationships over dinners and golf until they were ready to consider doing business with each other. Each option is it's own tool and there’s a time and place for each of them. I'll tell you the ones that I use regularly and how I prefer to use them. And for completeness, I'll also include a few "power user" techniques that I've seen employed by the masters of the game.

## Text Based Alignment
<b>I’</b>ve mostly worked with engineers in my career and there’s a big cost if I interrupt them and take them away from their deep focus. I suspect this is true for pretty much any work where a single person needs to create something new, which pretty much covers most individual work I can imagine other than routine administrative or factory work. There’s all kinds of work that I can’t bring myself get started on (like writing this post) if I think I won’t have a big chunk of uninterrupted time. If I break out of my flow in the middle of it, I might not be able to get back into it in the time I have left. I try to respect this reality for others. Whenever reasonable, I’ll communicate over text with them. The three text-based tools I like to use are IM, email, and documents.

### Instant Messaging
I use this when I need to clarify minor facts with small number of other people, usually just one other. Whatever the issue is, we largely see eye to eye on it. What I’m saying wont require much interpretation (i.e. it’s obvious) or the other person has all the context they need to understand and would be comfortable responding in realtime. I might ask a quick question or make a statement that corrects an understanding:

> ME: hey dave, isn’t our meeting supposed to be in 30 minutes?

> DAVE: i thought we moved it to tomorrow

> ME: oh right :)


### Email
It’s become bad form in tech companies to use email when IM would suffice. As a leader, I’m often away from my desk so I often use email for simple things that aren’t time sensitive. But not every question can be answered off the cuff. If I think the other person needs time to process my question or statement, then I’ll strongly prefer sending it over email. This might be because they need to reflect on it or do some research or perform a non-trivial task to come up with a response. The content is likely to be longer and can have more interpretation compared to IMs, which I like to keep as factual as possible, other than jokes :)

Here’s a short email thread of a dev team getting aligned on their commitment for the week:

> ME: Hey Daniel and team, Do all of you think we can release on time this week? I’d like to know what it’s going to take. -Vlad

> _(Daniel takes some time to look at the outstanding tickets and pull requests)_

> DANIEL: Vlad, I think we can do it, but it will be tight. Rika, looks like you have the biggest load, what do you think?

> RIKA: I think we can do it if we punt on issue PL-583 til next week

### Documents
I discovered the power of these surprisingly late in my career. I literally built multiple tech startups before I realized how useful these things are for building alignment and buy-in around complex thoughts or plans. Nowadays, the more people I need to get on the same page, the sooner I reach for these, particularly if I don’t or can’t know ahead of time everyone that I need to loop in, like people other departments or future hires. 

There’s a certain life to documents. They’re aren’t transient like IMs or emails. You probably don’t want to be forwarding email threads to new hires for months or years on end. And some people don’t appreciate being cc’d on an email thread after it’s been discussed by a dozen others for a couple weeks. Unlike an email or IM conversation, people don’t have to go through the whole discussion and experience the entire process of creation to understand where people have settled on. The document is the latest state. I can revise it over time as that state changes, but otherwise it can be the authority on the latest common understanding, which sounds pretty close to what alignment is all about :)

### When I Use Each
Here’s a quick reference for when I reach for each mode of communication. I don’t actually go through this checklist every time I want to message someone. I’m breaking it down to make sure I’m not full of BS:

#### Lifetime
> Transient: _**Instant Message**_ or _**Email**_

> Long-lived: _**Document**_

#### Who to include
> I already know who needs to know: _**Instant Message**_

> A few others might come up: _**Email**_

> Unknown others: _**Document**_

#### Shared Context / New Complexity
> Simple facts or updates: _**Instant Message**_

> Might need some interpretation: _**Email**_

> New ideas in need of some head wrapping: _**Document**_

#### Importance / Sensitivity
> Can’t possibly scare or offend: _**Instant Message**_

> Could use some tact: _**Email**_ or _**Document**_

> Somebody might freak out: _**Do it in person!**_

## Live Human Alignment
<b>W</b>hen something is important or sensitive enough to really bother people, I prefer to have a live human interaction. There’s so much more that comes across beyond the content of people’s words and I often need or want to experience all that “more”. Even when it’s not that sensitive, I often find it easier and more efficient to have a 30-second conversation than a bunch of back and forth over IM or email through the course of a day. Most of my interactions are one of: informal chats, one-on-ones and meetings.

## Informal Chats
I use these for getting aligned on simple topics when there’s likely to be a lot of back and forth, like when there isn’t enough shared context for an IM or if there’s something sensitive about the topic for me or the other person. These are typically unscheduled, otherwise I call them a “one on one” and treat them differently. A lot of the time sometime just comes up and it’s easiest to talk it through live. I might walk up to someone’s desk or call them up on their phone or over video. I might even have a side chat in the middle of a larger meeting during a transition time while the presenter is futzing with IT issues, which happens surprising often in our era. 

Here’s a fictional chat that I could have had right after a meeting where the VP of marketing just presented his desired marketing strategy for the next quarter:

> ME: Krish, you got a second?

> KRISH (VP of Mktg): Sure man.

> ME: It sounded like you’re planning a lot of new widgets for the corporate blog. How much eng help were you imagining?

> KRISH: As much as you can spare, as always _(smiling)_. We’re actually thinking of hiring a contract Wordpress dev to do most of it.

> ME: Oh, that’s a relief. I was expecting the eng team to be slammed with the product goals for the quarter. I’m guessing you’ll need some help from us anyway, though.

> KRISH: What do you mean?

> ME: To hire and support the contractor.

> KRISH: Yeah, man. That would be great. I know you guys are busy.

> ME: Ok, cool. I’ll talk to the eng team about how what that might take. It should be fine so let’s go ahead on this unless I let you know otherwise.

Notice how we didn’t do anything to establish a relationship based on common interests or concerns. We just assumed it because we must have had it from past interactions. Keep this chat in mind because we’re going to break it down later. For now, let’s talk about how this is different from one on ones.

## One on Ones
As a leader and a manger, these are my bread-and-butter. I do them all day every day. I have them with my team members, my peers, my boss, and other colleagues that are strategically important for me and my org to be effective. I prefer to meet people face-to-face, but I’ll settle for phone calls or video if in person isn’t an option. I try to go into all one on ones with one particular intention, though I may be juggling several secondary topics too. My intentions fall into one of three categories: developing a relationship, exploring future possibilities, and coordinating actions.

If I’m meeting with someone for the first time, my first priority is always to establish a relationship, otherwise it’s basically impossible to get things done without treating each other as cogs in a machine rather than the human beings that we are, each with our own unique needs and desires. If for some reason my work demands that I get something done with someone new, then I’ll usually spend the first 50–60% of our time establishing relationship and the remainder on exploring possibilities and taking whatever action we agree on. 

Most of the time my one on ones are scheduled and recurring anywhere between weekly and monthly.
