# Three Conversations That Made Me a More Effective Leader

> _Conversation is a skill that we can improve at. One of the most powerful developments I've had as a leader was building my competence at the three types of conversations: for relationship, for possibility, and for action._

<b>T</b>here's a particular incident from my time at Workday when I struggled to get [buy-in and alignment from my team](/alignment-and-buy-in). It bothered me for years and I've learned a lot from it. Check out that link for the back story.

By forcefully pushing my idea, I created angst and frustration for my managers and myself and got nothing for it. How did I get things so wrong? I can see now--with the befit of hindsight and the kind of wisdom that forms from prolonged pain and discomfort--that I never had the right kind of _**conversations**_ with my team. In the rest of this essay, I'm going to explore what those might have been and see if there was a more effective way I could have behaved as a leader.

## The Three Types of Conversations
<b>I</b> used to think I was pretty good at having conversations. I'd say something, you'd respond, and we'd go back and forth for a while. There's an art and nuance to conversations. Often they're fun. Sometimes they're boring. Occasionally they're painful as hell. I've had some friends who are so obviously better at it than me and I would have had a hard time telling you how or why.

About a year after the Workday incident, I found out that people smarter and more thoughtful than me have been thinking about how our fellow humans get things done together for a long time. There's this one model that I learned from coach and author James Flaherty that he called the _**three types of conversations**_. These conversations are sequential. Each one needs to precede the next in order to work. And as I look back, I can see that many of the times that I've tripped and fallen on my face as a leader were because I skipped a step or two. The conversations are:

> **For Relationship -** This is where we get to know each other and discover what interests, concerns, and commitments we have in common.

> **For Possibility -** Here we openly explore what actions we might take without judgement and try to discover new possibilities.

> **For Action -** This one is last because it's only after we've established a relationship and explored possible ways forward can we effectively take action together.

### Conversations for Relationship

For most of my life, I only got into conversations for relationship by accident. I had this idea that people who deliberately had conversations to build relationships were being fake. _Relationships can't be contrived_ I thought. Schmoozing and networking were these distasteful things that I wanted to avoid. I thought that those who did it were being sleazy. And maybe some of them were. A part of me also felt that I wasn't any good at connecting with people, so I invented nasty stories about those who were so I could convince myself that I was better than those "sleazy conversationalists." That way I didn't have to face the sense of inadequacy that I secretly felt about not having many friends or having enough love and appreciation from others. Well according to Flaherty (and I believe this too) we can't be forced into relationships. We can only enter into one willingly and mutually. But we can _influence_ how quickly they develop and how close they can get. This is where conversational skill comes in. And if it's a skill, then it's something we can practice and improve at. So how do we do that?

First we need to understand _what is a relationship_? My take is that it's a mutual sense of connection and closeness. When we _relate_ to each other we are connecting over the things that we both care about, specifically, our common _**interests**_, _**concerns**_, and _**commitments**_. Each of those three offers the opportunity for different kinds of relationships.

#### Shared Interests
If we share an interest, like a hobby or a sport, we could be acquaintances and enjoy some activity together like watching a football game or a playing a match of Magic The Gathering. Or we can connect over some personal history like going to the same college or growing up in the same town. At this depth our relationship is going to be pretty casual. I'm not likely to get vulnerable enough to reveal something personally sensitive, like being abused physically and emotionally by my parents as a child, and possibly discover that we have that in common too.

#### Shared Concerns
Our concerns (desires, worries, etc) tend to be more meaningful for us. Most people I've worked with are pretty concerned about their jobs and careers, even if they're not committed to the companies they're working for. As limited as that is, you and I would probably be willing to work together on a task if we knew that we both cared about doing our jobs (and maybe advancing our careers too). We'd even tolerate the frictions of our different preferences and personality quirks to a limited degree.

#### Shared Commitments
It's only when we have shared commitments that long-lasting collaborations become possible. Parents have the ultimate commitment in their children. It's why it can be so easy for them to relate while picking up their kids from school. Purpose-driven startup co-founders sometimes share commitments to whatever it is their company stands for. Though I would guess that only a minority of founders are genuinely committed to a larger purpose behind their company. That's a whole other conversation. 

When you and I have a shared commitment, we are willing to work through disagreements and confusion and difficult emotions. We can also share in the joy of positive developments with such an intensity that someone who is simply interested but not committed wouldn't feel.

Part of what makes my coaching work so powerful is that I am committed to my clients' commitments (within the boundaries of coaching, of course). Our mutual commitment opens a world of possibilities for the relationship. It's what allows me and my clients to be open and vulnerable enough with each other for deep and meaningful shifts to occur.


### Conversations for Possibility

I've had so many breakdowns in both life and at work because I didn't make the distinction between talking about possibilities and coordinating action.
