# Three Conversations That Made Me a More Effective Leader

> _One of the most powerful developments I've had as a leader was deliberately building my skill at the three types of conversations: for relationship, for possibility, and for action._

<b>T</b>here's a particular incident from my time at Workday when I struggled to get [buy-in and alignment from my team](/alignment-and-buy-in). It bothered me enough that I kept learning from it for years afterwards. Check out that link if you'd like the back story. In short, I had just discovered this startup that offered a simple and fun product for doing peer feedback and I decided my team needed it, and soon. I only had a vague notion of what problem it was going solve for us--presumably we didn't have enough of or the right kind of feedback--but I was sure the team would love it. I brought it up with the managers on my team and was shocked when they weren't as nearly excited as I was, which is putting it mildly. I insisted that we try it anyway as an "experiment" and since I was the boss, I got my way. So we tried it for a while and most of my team members used it and actually had fun giving each other feedback just as I predicted. But the managers didn't engage with it much. Over the next several months, this experiment slowly withered and we never managed the kind of value from the feedback product that I had imagined was possible. Eventually it was just another one of Vlad's ideas that we had tried once.

I had been forceful in pushing this idea and created angst and frustration for my managers and myself and got nothing for it. How did I get things so wrong? I can see now--with the befit of hindsight and the kind of wisdom that forms from prolonged pain and discomfort--that I never had the right kind of _**conversations**_ with my team. In the rest of this essay, I'm going to explore what those might have been and see if there was a more effective way I could have behaved as a leader.

## The Three Types of Conversations
<b>I</b> used to think I was pretty good at having conversations. I say something, you respond, and we go back and forth for a while. There's an art and nuance to conversations. Often they're fun. Sometimes they're boring. Occasionally they're painful as hell. I've had some friends who are so obviously better at it than me and I would have had a hard time telling you how or why.

About a year after the Workday incident, I found out that people smarter and more thoughtful than me have been thinking about how our fellow humans get things done together for a long time. There's this one model that I learned from coach and author James Flaherty that he called the _**three types of conversations**_. In this model the conversations sequential. Each one needs to precede the next in order to work. And as I look back, I can see that many of the times that I've tripped and fallen on my face as a leader were because I skipped a step or two. The three conversations are:

> **For Relationship -** This is where we know each other and discover what interests, concerns, and commitments we have in common.

> **For Possibility -** Here we openly explore what actions we might take without judgement and try to discover new possibilities.

> **For Action -** This one is last because it's only after we've established a relationship and explored possible ways forward can we effectively take action together.

### Conversations for Relationship

For most of my life, I only got into conversations for relationship by accident. I had this idea that people who deliberately had conversations to build relationships were being fake. _Relationships can't be contrived_ I thought. Schmoozing and networking were these distasteful things that I wanted to avoid. I thought that those who did it were being sleazy. And maybe some of them were. A part of me also felt that I wasn't any good at connecting with people, so I invented nasty stories about those who were so I could convince myself that I was better than those "sleazy conversationalists." That way I didn't have to face the sense of inadequacy that I felt deep down about not having many friends or having enough love and appreciation from others. Well according to Flaherty (and I believe this too) we can't be forced into relationships. We can only enter into one willingly and mutually. But we can _influence_ how quickly they develop and how deep they can get. This is where conversational skill comes in. And if it's a skill, then it's something we can practice and improve at.

A relationship is our sense of mutual connection and closeness. When we _relate_ to each other we are connecting over our common _**interests**_, _**concerns**_, and _**commitments**_,
