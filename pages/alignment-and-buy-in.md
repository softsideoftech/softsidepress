# I failed to reach alignment with my team and it cost me

<b>I</b> find myself thinking back often to the time when the lesson of _**alignment and buy-in**_ finally sunk in for me. A few years ago when I was leading the data products team at Workday (known as the SYMAN team), I came across a startup that was offering a continuous feedback product that I got excited about. This new product looked like it could supplement periodic manager feedback with lightweight peer-to-peer feedback that was ongoing and also anonymous so that everyone would be comfortable sharing. We had just grown from a 20 person team to a more than 50 person “org” inside of a year and I was hearing more and more about frictions between different  teams within my org. I was hoping that this feedback product would shed some light on the frictions to the people causing those frictions and to the managers who actually ran the org on a day to day basis.

I talked to the startup founder about letting us trial the product with the whole team. As soon as we struck the deal, I went to my leadership team, the top four SYMAN managers, and let them know about how great this product was and how it was going to give  us more insight into our people and help us relieve some of the tensions that had built up across their teams. The room got quiet. I didn’t get the questions or excitement that I was expecting. I just saw what looked like nervous faces eyeing each other. We eventually had some strained conversation about it and no one outright objected. I could tell the managers weren’t totally bought in so I asked them to give it shot for a month or two to see how it goes. Worst case, it’s an experiment that doesn’t work out. But I had a grand vision for the best case. In that vision this product gave our people transparency into how they’re being perceived and experienced by others in a safe and tactful way. It would surface the issues that were at the root of their personal development challenges, which would be great topics to discuss with their managers in a more open way.

So we went ahead with it. Or rather, I did. The next week, I invited the founder of the feedback product to address the SYMAN org at our all-hands meeting. He showed us a nice demo and did his best to sell everyone on it. The response from the team felt lukewarm. No one particularly objected so I took that as a good sign. I figured that once people used the product for a while and we started to experience the benefits that I was imagining, they would then get excited. Fast forward a couple months, most people on the team had used the quick feedback a couple times and a handful of people were using it on an ongoing basis. But no one was talking about it. I didn’t see any signs that anyone had any useful insights or conversations with their manager because of it. And the SYMAN leadership sounded very “meh” about it whenever I asked them at our weekly strategy meeting. Usage trailed off over the next several months and we eventually put it out of its misery and shut it off.

So what happened? Was my vision really that out of touch with reality? Maybe it was. I don’t know. But as an experiment it was doomed from the start. I never got alignment from my leadership team about what problem we were trying to solve, and they certainly weren’t bought into the solution that I imposed. What exactly is alignment and buy-in? Why does it matter? And how do I go about achieving it?

<b>A</b>lignment and buy-in are two different concepts that are related to each other and are all too often conflated with each other. I find it easier to distinguish them by thinking about their literal meanings instead of the metaphorical ones that we’re used to:

> When two objects are _**aligned**_ it means that they are oriented in the same direction.

> When a person or organization _**buys-in**_ it means that they are purchasing a stake in some venture (or a poker game) and thus are literally invested in the outcome.

When it comes to groups of people, _**alignment**_ means that those people share a common perspective of a situation or problem. They might not agree on the way forward, but they recognize the same underlying facts and agree on the interpretation of those facts. Looking back to SYMAN leadership a few years ago, it’s not clear to me that we were aligned about what problem the feedback product was supposed to solve. I think I could have gotten people to agree that some developers on one team were frustrated with developers on another team because they had different expectations of each other. But I don’t know if everyone would have characterized that as “frictions” between the teams. And what exactly was causing those frictions? We didn’t have those conversation out in the open. 

_**Buy-in**_ is a whole different animal. It’s not about shared perspectives. It’s about commitment. If someone is bought into a course of action, it means they will actively carry out that action in earnest. And they definitely won’t drag their heels or undermine the action in any way. The SYMAN managers didn’t get in the way of rolling out the feedback product. But they did little to help it be successful. They didn’t spend much time analyzing the results or have focused conversations with their team about it. Had they made a point of talking about it with their teams at a group and individual level, then maybe it would have had chance. They weren’t bought into it. And I knew it. For me personally, it’s hard to be bought-in without also being aligned just like it was hard for my managers. 

When I’m trying to execute quickly in a complex situation, it can be hard to always reach alignment before getting to the buy-in. But it doesn’t mean I can only get buy-in if I have alignment first. Amazon has made it a company principle for people to be willing to disagree and commit. But we didn’t have this kind of culture in place on the SYMAN team. In my rush and excitement to help them, I dispensed with this whole process and my results were about what I should have expected. I also undermined my power and authority with the team by trying to push something through and failing at it. It was a painful blow to my ego as a leader and I’ve thought back to it many times over the years.
