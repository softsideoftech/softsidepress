Hi {{.FirstName}},

I'd like to share something with you. I've been going through an inner transformation over the last few years. As part of my healing process, I'm writing essays about the painful experiences that led me down this path. Most of these are about my work life in the SF tech industry. 

I'm not offering you any morals, just the story about what happened and my raw thoughts and feelings about it. I feel uncomfortable sharing this, but I want to reveal more of who I really am to you and the world. Sharing helps me feel more whole and perhaps you might benefit from it, too.

My first story is about what really motivated me when I took the CTO job at Clara Lending and how it all played out:

If you have any thought or response you'd like to share, please email me back. I would love to hear from you.

Sincerely, Vlad
