Hi {{.FirstName}},

Over the next few months, I'll be sharing with you my struggles in the tech industry, in life, in my marriage, with my kids--everything.

I'm sending this to all my LinkedIn contacts so if this isn't for you, you can click the link at the bottom. It's ok, I won't be offended.

Since you're still here, I'll admit to you now that I'm on edge as I write this. What follows is the story of what led me to leave the tech industry almost exactly a year ago. I quit my job, rented out my SF condo, and bought one-way tickets from San Francisco to Amsterdam for me, my wife, and my two little girls.

I had been secretly suffering for years while trying to live the Silicon Valley dream. It was such a secret I didn't realize it myself most of the time. But every now and then when things got a little too calm at work and at home, I could feel this sense of emptiness come upon me. It was like everything in my life was meaningless and I was going to wake up one day wondering where all the time had passed. I would quickly make my life more complicated again and forget all about it.

I kept this up for years until I finally couldn't lie to myself anymore. My life, particularly at work, _was_ meaningless. Maybe not completely, but mostly.

This is the story of my last job, my last straw. This is [how my secret motivations drove me to reevaluate my life](https://softsideoftech.com/motivation-at-clara).

If this story resonates with you for good or for bad, please reply. I'd appreciate reading what you have to share.

Warmly,<br/>Vlad
