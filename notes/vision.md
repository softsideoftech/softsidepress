# The Future of How We Work

I see see a world where all of us are fulfilled with what we do. We don't have jobs, we live out our vocations.

We don't have to hide what we feel or believe from each other. And no one praises us for being so vulnerable because when we disagree with someone, we get curious and ask questions instead of judging.

There are no more "experts." We are all learners living with beginners' minds. When one of us stumbles and falls, the rest of us are there to pick them up. We graciously receive and give feedback out of love and a authentic desire to deepen into our true selves, not to "fix" one another.
